# Unity/C# Save System
You can use this for unity too!
Please report bugs, if you find any.

You can use it by entering your save path in the script, importing ClimatrixSave namespace and simply using these functions;

SaveSystem.ReadFile <The Type of Data You Want to Read> ("Your Key", "Your Default Value");
Returns the value with the type you stated.

SaveSystem.SaveFile <The Type of Data You Want to Read> ("Your Key", "Your Data");
Writes the data you stated in the save file.

Good Luck!
